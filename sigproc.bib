abstract = {
We present a new learning architecture: the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph 
(DDAG), which is used to combine many two­class classifiers into a multiclass 
classifier. For an N­class problem, the DDAG contains N(N-1)/2 classifiers, one 
for each pair of classes. We present a VC analysis of the case when the node 
classifiers are hyperplanes; the resulting bound on the test error depends on N 
and on the margin achieved at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. 
This motivates an algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel­induced feature 
space and uses two­class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision­node of the 
DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evaluate than either the 
standard algorithm or Max Wins, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of 
these algorithms.
